"# BachelorProject" 

This Github contains several exploratory studies as part of the preliminary part of the bachelor project. In 'DataPreprocess' you find the scripts for preprocessing the data and extracting cropped CT data sets. In 'PreliminaryStudies' you find notebooks for the preliminary studies regarding attenuation densities, gaussian mixture models (GMM), and pleural effusion.


# BachelorProject

Welcome to the repository for **BachelorProject**! This repository contains exploratory studies and tools developed as part of the preliminary phase of a bachelor project. Below, you will find an overview of the repository structure and a description of its key components.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **DataPreprocess**
This folder contains scripts and tools for preprocessing CT data. Key functionalities include:
- **Data preprocessing**: Preparing raw CT data for analysis.
- **Cropped CT data extraction**: Extracting focused subsets of CT data for detailed studies.

### 2. **PreliminaryStudies**
This folder includes Jupyter notebooks and analyses related to preliminary exploratory studies:
- **Attenuation Densities**: Investigations into the distribution and significance of attenuation densities in CT data.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Applications of GMM for clustering and analysis of CT data features.
- **Pleural Effusion**: Preliminary studies on pleural effusion, focusing on its detection and characteristics in CT scans.
